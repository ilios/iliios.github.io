The Ilios Demo site is available at [https://ilios-demo.ucsf.edu](https://ilios3-demo.ucsf.edu){:target="_blank"}.

This demo site serves multiple purposes. First, it provides a live location for potential users to explore and understand the Ilios application; second, it is our sample of just how Ilios can live as a secure, cloud hosted curriculum management tool; finally,since it is being fully populated with curricular data from the UCSF, it allows interested parties to review and analyze the current curriculum in place at UCSF and how that is being represented in Ilios, organized in the competency framework model, and presented to our learners.

Please contact us via [support@iliosproject.org](mailto:support@iliosproject.org) to request a user name, password, and access instructions.
