Hi all! We are pleased to announce the release of version __3.11__. This update includes API performance improvements and upgrades, and a number of frontend improvements and cleanups. Please feel free to contact us at [support@iliosproject.org](mailto:support@iliosproject.org) if you have any questions about this or any other release. You can see the full details of this release in  [the latest release announcement here](http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=845c4ebabb5b5ae7a6372c715&id=b86c241490){:target="_blank"}.

Just as an aside, as I write this update, we are busy in our monthly Ilios Codejam at a top-secret, undisclosed offsite location  (a.k.a. any spot nearby with decent wireless, somewhere the group can work together, and proximity to food). But if you'd ever like to be a part of our codejams, just let us know, and we will link you in, either in person or virtually: the more contributors we have, the better the system becomes!
