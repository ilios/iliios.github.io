Just a few words on our current rapid release cycle:

Since ilios v3 was launched back in December, we have been on a highly accelerated release schedule (3.2 and counting!), tagging a new codebase with updates and fixes pretty much every week. Our intention is to continue on this cycle until we reach a plateau of stability and feature-parity with our rather lofty goals; at that point I expect we will slow down (slightly). Our intention though is to maintain a much more rapid (though not breakneck) pace for release, in order to continue to provide more and better tools, features, and support for a 21st century curriculum.

We are learning quite a bit about juggling a system with multiple repositories, not to mention the challenge of keeping our naming conventions and semantic versioning in line.

If you have questions about the code or the process, or want advice on how best to keep up with the releases, please let us know and we will be happy to work with you.
