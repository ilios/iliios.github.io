For those of you attending the AAMC Medical Education Meeting in Chicago this week, **November 6-7** : I will be available for one-on-one meetings, general catching up, Q&A, drop-in times, and any issues or discussions Ilios-related. If you’d like to schedule some time, please don’t hesitate to let me know at [sascha.cohen@ucsf.edu](mailto:sascha.cohen@ucsf.edu), or via [info@iliosproject.org](mailto:info@iliosproject.org?subject=AAMC Chicago). And of course, you can always just give us a shout if you want to talk about anything or have any questions. We really do like to hear from you!
