As most of you know, we released the latest update to Ilios the other day, version _3.7.0_. What's new?

* Tons of bug fixes!
* Faster performance!
* Ability to create recurring events!
* Calendar icons for recent updates!
* improved print view!
* Automatic delivery of frontend updates!Â 

   ...And lots more as well. [Check it out!](https://github.com/ilios/ilios/releases/tag/v3.7.0)

Our next sprint will allow us to launch v1.2 of the Ilios API, which will make it possible to expose our new tagging vocabulary model, along with a number of other improvements. Keep an eye out later this month for the next release.
