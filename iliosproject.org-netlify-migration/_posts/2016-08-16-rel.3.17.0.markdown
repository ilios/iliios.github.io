We are very happy to announce the latest update to Ilios, v3.17.0, and a host of great updates to the interface. Among the newly introduced features:

- _*Curriculum Inventory Report tools are now available for immediate use*_
- Ilios now allows the ability to select, map, and manage competencies which have no sub-domains
- Corrected the application of learner group default instructor and location values to small group offerings
- Improved display of ILM events in the dashboard agenda list view
- A whole bunch of bug fixes, UI cleanup, and housekeeping.

We know that many of you have been waiting for the updated CI tools, and we apologize for the delay. We will be adding enahncements to them over the coming weeks to simplify report creation, and hope you are pleased with the results of this effort!
