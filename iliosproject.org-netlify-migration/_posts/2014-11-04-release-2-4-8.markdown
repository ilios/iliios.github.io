We are pleased to announce the release of version 2.4.8, available now for download and installation.

This point release includes a number of workflow enhancements to improve the Ilios experience:

- A new option for populating user groups, allowing new top level groups to either be pre-populated or generated with no members;
- Better color contrast for the icon denoting “scheduled” sessions in the course management pages
- This release also corrects a bug introduced with 2.4.7, which disabled the ability to add new users via the administration console.

The full changelist, along with the code download for install and/or upgrade, can be found here:
