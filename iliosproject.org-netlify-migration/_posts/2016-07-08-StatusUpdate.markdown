 We are happy to report that we have now released version __3.15__, and brought numerous improvements and feature updates to the frontend and API. This update drops support for PHP 5.5, which has reached end of life and is no longer supported, and moves us to a new baseline requirement of PHP 5.6, as noted below. Before updating to this version, please make sure that your server systems are running PHP 5.6 or greater.
