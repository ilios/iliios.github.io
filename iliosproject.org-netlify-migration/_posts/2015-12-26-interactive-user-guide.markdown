In order to make your life easier, we have published the first draft of our [3.0 user guide](https://www.gitbook.com/@iliosproject/){:target="_blank"} as an online interactive book. You can now click thru and navigate more easily from section to section, search for just what you need, and of course download it to peruse at your leisure as you have always been able to do. More importantly, this format allows us to rapidly update the document as needed in order to respond to changes and updates, and to provide you with pretty much instant access to those updates.

We also are building a "Quick'n'Easy" version of the guide, to provide brief, simple instructions targeted at the most common uses and users.

Both these books are still in draft, but please feel free to review them, use them, and give us feedback and suggestions!
