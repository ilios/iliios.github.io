No release this week, but while we are waiting for a few final fixes to push out the next bundle of updates, I wanted to give you a sense of where we are at with development:

As noted previously, our current sprint will allow us to launch v1.2 of the Ilios API, which will make it possible to expose our new tagging vocabulary model. Other items in the works include improvements to learner groups -- we have put back in the ability to auto-generate sub groups -- as well as further advancement of our user and school management tools. These include at long last the ability to manage some of your basic lookup data at the school level via the Ilios interface, rather than resorting to directly managing that data in the database. The first of these is our competency manager, which along with the vocabulary manager will allow the editing and management of competencies, topics, the new AAMC/Medbiquitous list of instructional resources, and any additional tagging vocabularies that your school may add or customize.

We will be releasing a ton of new features in the coming weeks as well --- user management for LDAP directory connections, course cloning and rollover from the UI, and our new improved Curriculum Inventory tools among them, as well as an improved MeSH parsing tool to let you more easily update your MeSH information to the most current data NLM offers --- so keep an eye open and an ear to the ground, and if you have a chance, let us know what you think!
