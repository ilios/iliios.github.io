__STATUS__:
- current version: __3.60.0__
- next scheduled release: __2/13/2019__

Welcome to a new year, a new release, and a new set of development goals for the Ilios Project in the coming year! Key features identified as target milestones for our 2019-20 roadmap include:

*SEARCH*: We have begun a year-long initiative to begin the incorporation of deep search. We expect to include search across the entire curriculum and its content.

*Session Linking*: Session linking tools will be available in the next release.

*Configurable options*: We expect to be providing the ability to modify an array of different school level attributes, including the time-window for calendar integrations and dashboard displays, naming conventions, and more.

*Selectives*: The ability to tag and group sessions as selectives within the curriculum.

*Improved and extended rollover*: This will allow the rollover of entire group trees. There will also be selective choice of attributes for rollover in a course. Finally, this will include better publishing control.

*Improved Curriculum Inventory tools*: Better, more flexible tools to represent your curriculum to the AAMC Curriculum Inventory.

Further information on the roadmap is available in our Github repository.
