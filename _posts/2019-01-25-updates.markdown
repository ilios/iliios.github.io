__STATUS__:
- current version: __3.60.0__
- next scheduled release: __2/13/2019__

Welcome to a new year, a new release, and a new set of development goals for the Ilios Project in the coming year! Among the key features identified as target milestones for our 2019-20 roadmap we are happy to note:

SEARCH: We have begun a year-long initiative to begin the incorporation of deep search to the Ilios platform. We hope to be able to include search across the entire curriculum and its content  - from learning objectives to learning materials - and will keep you all apprised of progress in this area.

Session Linking: Beginning with the next release, the session linking tools will be available for Ilios.

Configurable options: We expect to be providing the ability to modify an array of different school level attributes, including the time-window for calendar integrations and dashboard displays, naming conventions, and more.

Selectives: The abilty to tag and group sessions as selectives within the curriculum.

Improved and extended rollover: allowing the rollover of entire group trees, selective choice of attributes for rollover in a course, and better publishing control.

Further information on the roadmap is available in our Github repository.
