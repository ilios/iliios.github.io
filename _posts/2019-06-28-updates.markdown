With the latest release, **v3.67.0**, we have taken the "experimental" flag off the new search API. While it isn't yet exposed, it will soon be available to hosted Ilios schools. If you are running ilios locally, please contact us before looking to implement, as there are some significant additional tools and systems required.

We've improved our interfaces for a better experience with page loading, and also updated the Curriculum Inventory tools to address changes mandated by the AAMC for this cycle.

In the meantime...Curious about [Ilios hosting](/hosting){:target="_hosting_cust"}? check it out, and [contact us](mailto:support@iliosproject.org)! Curious about LTIs? We've got 'em for the Dashboard and Calendar, and for Course Management! [Contact us](mailto:support@iliosproject.org) to find out more!

__STATUS__:
- current version: __3.67.0__
- next scheduled release: __7/12/2019__
