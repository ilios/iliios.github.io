This week we are happy to announce the final release of 2017, __v3.41.0__, which includes a bunch of nice updates, including further refinement of reporting and course visualization, login improvements, and the addition at long last of calendar filters for vocabulary terms on the dashboard calendar. This is also the first release impacted by our new PHP version support policy. Please check out the latest [weekly update](https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=845c4ebabb5b5ae7a6372c715&id=9b443157d6) for information regarding our new policy around PHP version support.
