We are pleased to announce the immediate release of Ilios **v3.38.0**. This release provides two key new features:

1. A completely renovated and updated MeSH importer, allowing easy command-line updating of your compendium of available MeSH terms to the very latest vocabulary released by NLM;

2. Timed release of Learning Materials, along with an updated interface for LM management. Now materials can be released at a specified future time, made available for a limited time only, or pulled back from release after a desired window.
