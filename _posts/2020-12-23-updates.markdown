    ILIOS:
    Still knocking it out of the park!          

At the end of **January 2021**, we completed the deprecation and EOL of our v1 API, and now all external connections to Ilios - beginning with Ilios **v3.86.0** - require calls to the current *v3 API*. This has been detailed in the User Guide, and in the newsletters from July 2020 onward. But if you have any questions, please reach out to us.

In addition, 2021 is looking to be yet another tremendous year for Ilios development and growth; we have lots in store in way of improvements and expansions, and you should be seeing these in the coming months.



__CURRENT STATUS__:
- current version: __3.86.0__
- next scheduled release: __02//2021__
