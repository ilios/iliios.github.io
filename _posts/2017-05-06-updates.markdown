We are extremely pleased to announce the release of Ilios __v3.32.0__, available for immediate download and deployment.

Along with a number of data improvements and bugfixes, this release includes the new ability to manage session types and their associated calendar colors directly in the UI, via the school administration page; and the first pilot introduction of native Ilios Course Data Visualizations -- this one showing the weighted instructional time value of a course's objectives.
