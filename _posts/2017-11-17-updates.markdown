Ilios __v3.40.0__ has just been released, with a ton of bugfixes, performance enhancements, and improvements to the mobile experience. We're still keeping a low profile in order to focus on the new permissions work, and do housekeeping as we move into the holiday season. Also, please check out the latest [weekly update](https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=845c4ebabb5b5ae7a6372c715&id=9b443157d6) for information regarding our new policy around PHP version support.

If you haven't yet had a chance to update your systems to the latest release, now is a great time to do so!
