With the release on August 23 2019 of **v3.68.1**, the new search tools for Ilios are fully operational. If you are hosted with us, you should be seeing the new search in the header per the screenshot above these words.

Search provides auto-suggest based on your input and your curricular content, and returns weighted responses tagged by content area.
