On September 30, 2019, **v3.69.2** was released, with updates to the Curriculum Inventory, search indexing, and a number of bugfixes to school management. Most notably, the Curriculum Inventory tools now include a verification report preview, allowing you to review your data in the primary tables from the AAMC verification report.

Additionally, we are happy to note major progress in our efforts to make Ilios fully accessible according to the WCAG standards. While already achieving a reasonably high rating (66%), our expectation is that by the end of this month, student-facing platform systems will be achieving a score of 75%+, with full AA compliance.

We continue to improve the new search tools, and would love to hear your feedback on their use. If you are a self-hosted school interested in activation search, please [contact us](mailto:support@iliosproject.org), or better yet, consider [hosting with us](/hosting){:target="_hosting_cust"} and be guaranteed to always stay up to date with new features and improvements.


In the meantime...Curious about LTIs? We've got 'em for the Dashboard and Calendar, and for Course Management! [Contact us](mailto:support@iliosproject.org) to find out more!
