It's St. Patrick's Day, and in honor of this auspiciously green day, we provide the following Q&A:

* _Re-ordering of Learning Materials?_
--> Sure Thing!

* _Re-ordering of Objectives?_
--> In the backend now, coming to your frontend next week!  

* _Brand New API Docs?_
--> Yeah, baby!

* _New session attributes and the ability to configure which get used/displayed?_
--> Yes indeedy!


It's all in today's update to __v3.29.0__.
