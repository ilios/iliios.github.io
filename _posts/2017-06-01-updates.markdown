We've been a little quiet the last couple weeks, so I thought it would be good to let you all know that while quiet, we aren't on vacation on some warm tropical beach in a hammock sipping drinks served in coconuts (as pleasant as that sounds!) We released Ilios __v3.33.0__ recently, which is available for immediate download and deployment. And we've been working away on a number of exciting developments, including some new exposure to the backend CI mapping tools, and an LTI component for Moodle, Canvas, and other LMS systems.

We will be officially launching and announcing all these great updates in our next cycle, but right now it's the slow summer season, and we continue to focus on our work from the undisclosed secure location of the Ilios bunker.

In the meantime, enjoy the new Session Type Management tools and the other latest greatest updates, and look out for more good stuff soon!
