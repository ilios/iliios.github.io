Our next release will be our *100th point release* for the 3rd version of the Ilios Curriculum Management tool. While this may seem a bit random, and non-important, it shows few critical successes:
 - **First:** The platform in it's v3 rendition has sustained and maintained its successful use and capability for 100 major cycles of development (and many hundreds of minor ones) since its launch in late 2015. This is a laudable lifecycle success.
 - **Second:** Ilios continues to grow and adapt without the need (yet) for a major rewrite. While all software needs eventual overhaul, it is another major success that we have yet to hit our point of a required development of a v4 for the platform. In our seventh year, we continue to thrive.
 - **Third:** *Continuity of Practice.* The core team has maintained its coherence and continuity of effort, and has extended the community in practice year over year - a badge of successful team effort, engagement, and management.
